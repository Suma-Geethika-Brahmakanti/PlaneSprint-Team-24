            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>When it comes to the world of technology, staying ahead of the curve is always a challenge. In the last year one aspect of this – the world wide web – has kicked up a gear with the introduction of HTML5, the newest version of the code that makes the web tick. If you learn HTML5 along with CSS3 (the next level of web design used on all modern websites), you’ll have a recipe for success; and this course will show you how.</p>
